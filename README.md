# nvim-metals

`nvim-metals` is a Lua plugin built to provide a better experience while using
Metals, the Scala Language Server, with Neovim's built-in [LSP
support](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html).[^no-lspconfig] You can see all
the available features
[here](https://github.com/scalameta/nvim-metals/discussions/279).

## Prerequisites

- Before you get started you need to ensure that you are using the latest nvim
v.0.11.x or newer. If you're still on an older version then you'll want to target the
tag that matches your release version.
- Ensure [Coursier](https://get-coursier.io/docs/cli-installation) is
    installed locally.[^coursier]
- Ensure that you have all the LSP mappings for the core functionality you want
    setup.[^mappings]
- Ensure [plenary.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim) is
    installed.[^plenary]
- Subscribe to [this
    discussion](https://github.com/scalameta/nvim-metals/discussions/253) which
    will notify you of any breaking changes.
- Unfamiliar with Lua and Neovim? Check out the great
    [`:h lua-guide`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua-guide.html#lua-guide).

## Getting started

_NOTE_: This plugin works without needing to install
[neovim/nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig). If you have
it installed for other languages, that's not a problem, but make sure you do not
have Metals configured through `nvim-lspconfig` while using this plugin.[^no-lspconfig]

## Absolute minimal example using [Lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
{
  "scalameta/nvim-metals",
  dependencies = {
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
  },
  ft = { "scala", "sbt", "java" },
  opts = function()
    local metals_config = require("metals").bare_config()
    metals_config.on_attach = function(client, bufnr)
      -- your on_attach function
    end

    return metals_config
  end,
  config = function(self, metals_config)
    local nvim_metals_group = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("nvim-metals", { clear = true })
    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("FileType", {
      pattern = self.ft,
      callback = function()
        require("metals").initialize_or_attach(metals_config)
      end,
      group = nvim_metals_group,
    })
  end
}
```

**NOTE**: The above assumes you have your own attach function that sets up all
your LSP mappings. It also doesn't make use of _any_ configuration. You'll
likely want a more involved setup than this, so check out the full minimal
example configuration link below.

- You can find a full [minimal example configuration
    here](https://github.com/scalameta/nvim-metals/discussions/39).
- You can find the full documentation with [`:help
    nvim-metals`](https://github.com/scalameta/nvim-metals/blob/main/doc/metals.txt).
- You can find a full [list of features here](https://github.com/scalameta/nvim-metals/discussions/279).

### Settings and Commands

To view all of the available commands, check out `:help metals-commands` in the
help docs. Similarly, to see the available configuration settings check out
`:help metals-settings`.

## Integrations

To see the full details on the available configurations, checkout out `:help
metals-integrations`. The currently available integrations are:
- [nvim-dap](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap)
- [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)


[^no-lspconfig]: If you're familiar with nvim and LSP you'll probably know of
  [`nvim-lspconfig`](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) which also has a
  Metals configuration. Note that this is a very minimal version with no
  specific Metals commands and no Metals extensions. You can see more info on
  this [here](https://github.com/scalameta/nvim-metals/discussions/93). **DO
  NOT** try to use Metals both with `nvim-lspconfig` and with `nvim-metals` as
  stuff *will* not work right.
[^coursier]: `nvim-metals` uses Coursier to download and update Metals. _NOTE_:
  On Windows, you should run `coursier` or `cs.exe` once from the command line
  as this is how it will install itself. Once this is done you should add
  `C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Coursier\data\bin` to your path. To verify that it
  is properly installed you can run `cs --help` from a new shell.
[^mappings]: By default methods for things like goto definition, find
  references, etc are there, but not automatically mapped. You can find a
  minimal example configuration
  [here](https://github.com/scalameta/nvim-metals/discussions/39).
[^plenary]: You're more than likely already relying on for other plugins.
  However, make sure to also have this installed as Metals uses it for things
  like Jobs, popups, and paths.
